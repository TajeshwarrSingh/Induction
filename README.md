# Induction
Day 1 July 31st 2025
The first day of our induction program began with a visit to the Gurdwara Sahib located inside the GNDEC campus. The Gurdwara Sahib is uniquely shaped like a ship, symbolizing the "Jahaz of Waheguru." We observed its structure from both inside and outside, noticing how its roof and design give the impression of a vessel sailing us on a spiritual journey, which we will be starting here at GNDEC for the next 4 years. We spent almost one hour in the divine atmosphere (8:30-9:30 A.M), soaking in the serenity and the spiritual teachings.

Inside the Gurdwara Sahib, the Kirtani Jatha recited soothing shabads. Although I missed the live session, I learned from my friends that the Kirtani Jatha deeply moved the audience with their melodious voices. The experience was a blend of spiritual reflection and cultural reverence.
Some of the shabads were 
- Satgur Hoye Dyal
- Kar Kirpa Tere Gun Gawan
- Apni Bhagti Laye..

After the programme at the college Gurudwara Sahib came to an end, Tea and snacks were arranged outside in hostel no.2 
bread pakodas, Gulab jamun, and cold drinks were being distributed to the guests.

Afterwards, we gathered in the auditorium at 10:30 A.M, where several respected guests addressed us. The seniors welcomed us. Following that, we participated in many inspirational and informative sessions delivered by seasoned faculty and dignitaries.

## Day 3: Expert Lecture by Dr. Jaswinder Singh (IAPT Incharge) on Examining the Inner and Ethical Self
An engaging and thought-provoking session in the auditorium kicked off the day. In order to encourage us to have a moment of quiet and introspection, Dr. Jaswinder Singh started by asking each student to close their eyes and focus inward. Following this quick meditation, he inquired about our feelings and observations. Some students reported a deep focus in the middle of their forehead, while others pictured future success or cosmic journeys. One student acknowledged that their mind was unable to settle, while another pictured Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

Dr.Jaswinder Singh used Gurbani, particularly the verse from Japji, to expertly relate these experiences to both scientific explanations and spiritual insights.
Going further, he presented different forms of meditation and offered insights from his own experiments and self-discovery experiences. He examined his own development as a speaker and disclosed that he approached every speaking engagement with sincerity and zeal, treating it as a test. He told us how fortunate we are to have such committed teachers guiding us and thanked the GNDEC faculty for their ongoing support.

He told a heartwarming tale about a girl who went to a job interview near the end. She gave an honest response when asked her father's name. "You've been chosen," the interviewer declared as soon as he got up. She was moved by this and silently acknowledged the greatness of her father, a man she had not previously fully comprehended. The narrative reaffirmed his point about the importance of his message on the importance of honesty, self-awareness, and the sometimes-unseen strength of those who support us was reaffirmed by the story.

Dr. Priya Darshni's Expert Lecture on "Universal Human Values"
The significance of Universal Human Values in our lives was the main topic of Dr. Priya Darshni's second session. She underlined the importance of self-awareness and knowing our responsibilities as members of society. She emphasized how virtues like empathy, trust, and respect not only define our personal character but also influence our social and professional relationships with her serene and introspective tone.

Her talk inspired us to take stock of our actions, think about how we treat others, and acknowledge the importance of inner values in creating a meaningful life. The session's serene and contemplative tone prompted us to think more carefully about our behavior and how we interact with others.
