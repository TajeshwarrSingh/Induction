# Induction
Day 1 July 31st 2025
The first day of our induction program began with a visit to the Gurdwara Sahib located inside the GNDEC campus. The Gurdwara Sahib is uniquely shaped like a ship, symbolizing the "Jahaz of Waheguru." We observed its structure from both inside and outside, noticing how its roof and design give the impression of a vessel sailing us on a spiritual journey which we will be starting here in GNDEC for the next 4 years. We spent almost one hour in the divine atmosphere (8:30-9:30 A.M), soaking in the serenity and the spiritual teachings.

Inside the Gurdwara Sahib, the Kirtani Jatha recited soothing shabads . Although I missed the live session, I learned from my friends that the Kirtani Jatha deeply moved the audience with their melodious voices. The experience was a blend of spiritual reflection and cultural reverence.

After the programme at the college Gurudwara Sahib came to an end Tea and snacks were arranged outside in hostel no.2 
bread pakodas,Gulab jamun and cold drinks were being distributed to the guests.

Afterwards, we gathered in the auditorium at 10:00 A.M where several respected guests addressed us.
